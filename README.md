This project implements a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of rooms, and more. The goal is to develop a robust and accurate model that can provide reliable price predictions for different properties.

Features of the Project:

Data Preprocessing:     Cleaning and handling missing values, feature engineering, and normalizing data for optimal model performance.
Modeling:     Uses machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest to predict house prices.
Evaluation:     Model evaluation using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared to measure the performance of the model.
Data Visualization:     Visualizing feature correlations and model predictions with Matplotlib and Seaborn for insights.
